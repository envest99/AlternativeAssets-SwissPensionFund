# Optimal Alternative Asset Allocation for Swiss Pension Funds
The objective of this report is to determine potential  for the asset management of Swiss pension funds. The low level of interest rates and the high Swiss franc reduced the performance of the third contributor and led to a consolidation of the industry and the development of investment opportunities. By international comparison, the high proportion of Swiss assets (PPCmetrics 'Home Bias') and the low proportion of alternative investments (excluding real estate) is striking. This is due on the one hand to historical habits and on the other hand to different market environments and structures. To determine the optimal asset and currency allocation, the chosen method is the commonly deployed Mean Variance Optimization (MVO). In the follow, a typical Swiss pension fund portfolio with its Swiss federal Ordinance on Occupational Old-Age, Survivorsâ€™ and Disability Benefit Plans (OOB2) recommended allocation limits is discussed. This includes also the aspect of allocation in foreign investments and its currency hedging as well as the optimal share of illiquid unlisted assets.
